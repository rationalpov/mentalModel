### Conditions:

For Evolution to form, it needs to be:

* Evolution
What triggers evolution and evolvement of species ? 

David Quammen paint a vivid history of how Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace discovered the key to evolution independently in his excellent book [The Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinction](https://www.amazon.com/Song-Dodo-Island-Biogeography-Extinction/dp/0684827123)

The main trigger is **geo seperation** , it is mostly visible in islands.
his also outline the science behind evolution, the number of species in the geo is proportional to the area, and the bigger the area, the high level of species in the food chain can survive.

* Selection ( a filter, or a breakpoint to filter the individuals ), mostly is the geo
* Breed

Individuals must be able to reproduce



### Predictions:

* Evolution is triggered by seperation
* The bigger the space(geo) is, it can evolute more complex and specicalized species.
