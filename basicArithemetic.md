# Introduction

The first mental model is basic arithmetic, it was one of the most important mental model according to Charlie Munger.Why it is important ? because it helps you do the modelling. When you convert things into a number, you are automatically building a model.

## How to use this mental Model:

Numbers doesn't make much sense alone, but it is much more useful to model reality and make a prediction out of it.

## Modeling

Use [spreadsheet](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) to a math model of the things your try to understand:

* Identify **critical path** \( from input to output\) you try to analyses;

* list Input/outputs
* identify any alternate route from input to outputs.
* try to scale it, what happens when multiple by 100 times ?

eg. for business , it is revenue and cost;



## Analysis and Prediction


* Lay down a spreadsheet , try to predict:

* the scenarios 12 months later.

* the input x 10 times, what happen to inputs and the system, will it break ?

* the output x 10 times, what does it take for inputs, will it break ?

* how the number translated into actual human experience ?



### Conditions:

None
