# Introduction

The first mental model is basic arithmetic, it was one of the most important mental model according to Charlie Munger.
Why it is so important ? Because it helps you do the modelling. When you convert things into a number, you are automatically building a model.

## How to use this mental Model:

Numbers doesn't make much sense alone, but it is much more useful to model it and try to make a prediction out of it.

## Simplification:

Claude Shannon in his speech on creative thinking, mentioned simplify a problem to its essentials is the very first step to resolve a complex problem.

> Suppose that you are given a problem to solve, I don’t care what kind of a problem - a machine to design, or a physical theory to develop, or a mathematical theorem to prove, or something of that kind - probably a very powerful approach to this is to attempt to eliminate everything from the problem except the essentials; that is, cut it down to size. Almost every problem that you come across is befuddled with all kinds of extraneous data of one sort or another; and if you can bring this problem down into the main issues, you can see more clearly what you’re trying to do and perhaps find a solution. Now, in so doing, you may have stripped away the problem that you’re after. You may have simplified it to a point that it doesn’t even resemble the problem that you started with; but very often if you can solve this simple problem, you can add refinements to the solution of this until you get back to the solution of the one you started with.
 
 
 
## Modeling

Use [spreadsheet](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) to a math model of the things your try to understand:

* Identify **critical path** \( from input to output\) you try to analyses;

* list Input/outputs
* identify any alternate route from input to outputs.
* try to scale it, what happens when multiple by 100 times ?

eg. for business , it is revenue and cost;



## Analysis and Prediction


* Lay down a spreadsheet , try to predict:

* the scenarios 12 months later.

* the input x 10 times, what happen to inputs and the system, will it break ?

* the output x 10 times, what does it take for inputs, will it break ?

* how the number translated into actual human experience ?



### Conditions:

None
