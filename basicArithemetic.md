# Introduction

The first mental model is basic arithmetic, it was one of the most important mental model according to Charlie Munger.Why it is important ? because it helps you do the modelling. When you convert things into a number, you are automatically building a model.

## How to use this mental Model:

Numbers doesn't make much sense alone, but it is much more useful to model reality and make a prediction out of it.

## Modeling

Use [spreadsheet](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) to a math model of the things your try to understand:

* Identify **critical path** \( from input to output\) you try to analyses;

* list Input/outputs
* identify any alternate route from input to outputs.
* try to scale it, what happens when multiple by 100 times ?

eg. for business , it is revenue and cost;



## Analysis and Prediction

* is it a **multiplicative** Or **Additive** System

The best explanation of multiplicative & additive system in [farnamstreetblog](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/08/mental-model-multiplicative-systems/)

The concept of multiplicative and additive is very powerful and govern many aspect of our lives:

Why market is so powerful and almost work like magic ?

Because it is a additive system, and offers matching between N number of buyer and M number of sellers. The combination between buyer and sellers exploded with number of buyer and seller increase.


Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson in their book Why Nations Fail examines the factors could be responsible for determinting countries success and failure,

they argues the factor such as geographic, climate, culture, religion, policitcal leader are either insufficient or defective in explaining it.

Acemoglu and Robinson's major argument is economic prosperity depends above all is whether the economic and political system is inclusive or extractive

inclusive system, is a additive one, and extractive system, is an multiplicative one.



Most of the system is a hybrid of these two.

For Mutiplicative part of it, you need to find out the weakest link of it, the whole chain is govern by it.

* Scale Valuables to Extreme

Move the needle 100x or 1000x, look at the numbers and try to translate it back to real life object/experience. What will break ? will it work ?

* Lay down a spreadsheet , try to predict:

* the scenarios 12 months later.

* the input x 10 times, what happen to inputs and the system, will it break ?

* the output x 10 times, what does it take for inputs, will it break ?

* how the number translated into actual human experience ?
