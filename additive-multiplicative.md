The best explanation of multiplicative & additive system in [farnamstreetblog](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/08/mental-model-multiplicative-systems/)

The concept of multiplicative and additive is very powerful and govern many aspect of our lives:

Why market is so powerful and almost work like magic ?

Because it is a additive system, and offers matching between N number of buyer and M number of sellers. The combination between buyer and sellers exploded with number of buyer and seller increase.



Most of the system is a hybrid of these two.

For Mutiplicative part of it, you need to find out the weakest link of it, the whole chain is govern by it.

* Scale Valuables to Extreme

Move the needle 100x or 1000x, look at the numbers and try to translate it back to real life object/experience. What will break ? will it work ?




## How to use this mental Model:



### Conditions:

### Predictions:

### Examples:

Example: Why nations fail

Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson in their book Why Nations Fail examines the factors could be responsible for determinting countries success and failure,

they argues the factor such as geographic, climate, culture, religion, policitcal leader are either insufficient or defective in explaining it.

Acemoglu and Robinson's major argument is economic prosperity depends above all is whether the economic and political system is inclusive or extractive one.

inclusive system, is a additive one, there is a lot of path to prosper, and you can compete freely.

and extractive system, is an multiplicative one. there is few path to prosper, once you are there you need to keep other from stealing your position.
