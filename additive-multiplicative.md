## geometric mean and arithmetic mean

arithmetic average is the simple one, you can use the formular = average() in excel to compute it.

geometric mean is the tricky one, it is calculated by multiple all the number together and take the Nth root to it.


To better explain the difference, Lets starts with gambling:



The best explanation of multiplicative & additive system in [farnamstreetblog](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/08/mental-model-multiplicative-systems/)

The concept of multiplicative and additive is very powerful and govern many aspect of our lives:

Why market is so powerful and almost work like magic ?

Because it is a additive system, and offers matching between N number of buyer and M number of sellers. The combination between buyer and sellers exploded with number of buyer and seller increase.


Most of the system is a hybrid of these two.

For Mutiplicative part of it, you need to find out the weakest link of it, the whole chain is govern by it.

> A “fair” wager is one where the expectation, computed as an arithmetic mean of equally likely outcomes, is zero. Here’s an example of a so-called fair wager. You bet your entire net worth on the flip of a coin. You play against your neighbor, who has the same net worth. It’s double or nothing. Winner gets the loser’s house, car, savings, everything. Right now you have $ 100,000, say. After the coin toss, you will either have $ 200,000 or $ 0, each an equally likely outcome. The arithmetic mean is ($ 200,000   $ 0) /2, or $ 100,000. If you adopt $ 100,000 as the fair and proper value of this wager, then it might seem you should be indifferent to taking this wager or not. You’ve got $ 100,000 now, and you expect the same amount after the coin toss. Same difference.





## How to use this mental Model:

Example: Why nations fail

Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson in their book Why Nations Fail examines the factors could be responsible for determinting countries success and failure,

they argues the factor such as geographic, climate, culture, religion, policitcal leader are either insufficient or defective in explaining it.

Acemoglu and Robinson's major argument is economic prosperity depends above all is whether the economic and political system is inclusive or extractive one.

inclusive system, is a additive one, there is a lot of path to prosper, and you can compete freely.

and extractive system, is an multiplicative one. there is few path to prosper, once you are there you need to keep other from stealing your position.
