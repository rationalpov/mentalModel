What defines a feedback loop ? it takes the system output and feedback to its input


There are two types of Feedback system:

* Positive Feedback:

> Positive feedback has the property that output signals tend to reinforce the input, and grow larger through compounding.

Positive Feedback is everywhere in live, and can lead to spectacular results.
Every successful startup is a living example of positive feedback, so as the rise of human race against other competing race.

In economics, positive feedback often called called **bubble**

In social media, it is called 'go viral'

* Negative Feedback:

> Negative feedback occurs when some function of the output of a system, process, or mechanism is fed back in a manner that tends to reduce the fluctuations in the output, whether caused by changes in the input or by other disturbances.

Negative Feedback has a very useful characteristic, it can stabilise the output, thus very useful in engineering and mother nature use it too.
> Blood glucose levels are maintained at a constant level in the body by a negative feedback mechanism. When the blood glucose level is too high, the pancreas secretes insulin and when the level is too low, the pancreas then secretes glucagon. The flat line shown represents the homeostatic set point. The sinusoidal line represents the blood glucose level. - wikipedia

Victor Niederhoffer in his book The Education of a Speculator mentions:

> One of the common features that all life possesses is a mechanism for maintaining orderly conditions. This tendency is called homeostasis. In system theory, it is called negative feedback â€¦ A Common homeostatic behavior in humans is temperature regulation. If the temperature rises above the 98.6 F optimum for normal human activity, sensors on the skin detect it and signal the brain that a rise has occurred. The brain relays the information to the effectors that increase blood flow to the skin. This induces perspiration. The loss in head, caused by evaporation, lowers the body temperature. When the body cools below a certain point, a comparable mechanism is set off, this time reducing blood flow and causing shivering. This activity generates heat through physical activity thus raising the body temperature.



### Conditions:

Path exist from output to input


### Predictions:


* Positive Feedbackloop

* the output will grow in compound interest.
* the output will decline sharply after the peak

* Negative Feedbackloop

* the output will be stable.


### Examples:



As an example of a positive feedback system, consider an audio amplification system with a speaker and a microphone.

Examples of Positive Feedback in daily life:

Economic: Housing Bubbles

George Soros in [The Alchemy of Finance](https://www.amazon.com/Alchemy-Finance-George-Soros/dp/0471445495/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1468051982&sr=8-1&keywords=soros+alchemy) mentions about theory reflexivity, once market is trapped in reflexivity, the market trend became certain. Certain means the output is predictable.

The attribution of theory of reflexivity could be just positive feedback:

the output of rising stock price/currency prices feedback to the input, the general publics psychology, generate the desire to chase profit -> buy the uptrend-> rising stock price/currency prices, it creates the positive feedback loop and will go on and on, until all the avaliable money was draw in, then the reaction will stop, and burble burst -> price fall

you got the idea.

John Gribbin in [Deep Simplicity: Bringing Order to Chaos and Complexity] argues Chaos, could be just positive feedback + uncertain initial starting position;

> The Millennium Bridge, a 320-meter-long lateral suspension bridge connecting London's financial district to Bankside, south of the river, opened June 10, 2000. Thousands of pedestrians streamed over it.

>At first, the bridge was still. Then it began to sway, just slightly.

> Then, almost from one moment to the next, the wobble intensified. And suddenly, people were walking like tentative ice skaters: planting their feet wide, pushing out to the side with each step. Left, right, left, right, in near-perfect unison.

> Instead of focusing on the structure, Strogatz examines the strange phenomenon of people unknowingly working together, simply by walking.

> The military has known for years that troops marching in step can create enough vertical force to destroy a bridge. It is standard practice for soldiers to break step at every bridge crossing.

> But the Millennium Bridge problem is not quite the same, says Strogatz. In this case, the movement was lateral, not vertical. More importantly, the people were just pedestrians. No one was trying to walk in step; pedestrians did so only to accommodate the bridge's movement under their feet.

That's a live demostration of positive feedbackloop. people were walking disorganized and random, but once a few of them got into sync by pure chance, the wobbling becomes marked enough to lead more and more people to snap into its freqenency and compounding wobbling.

> And the critical number of pedestrians, tested subsequently on the Millennium Bridge and derived independently by Strogatz and co-authors, is as low as 160. An estimated 80,000 people crossed the bridge on opening day, with as many as 2,000 on it at any one time.
