[Reynolds Number](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27056)

> “The internal motion of water assumes one or other of two broadly distinguishable forms,” Osborne Reynolds reported to the Royal Society in 1883. “Either the elements of the fluid follow one another along lines of motion which lead in the most direct manner to their destination, or they eddy about in sinuous paths the most indirect possible.” 

Reynolds figure out the transition point of a stable fluid turns into an unstable flow, is depends on the ratio between two forces, the inertial forces( defined by mass, velocity and distance) and viscous forces (defined by the stickiness of the fluid) 

Reynolds number is universal and appearing i blood pumping throuhg a heart and burning gas flowiing through jet turbine.
