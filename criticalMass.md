[Reynolds Number](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27056)

> “The internal motion of water assumes one or other of two broadly distinguishable forms,” Osborne Reynolds reported to the Royal Society in 1883. “Either the elements of the fluid follow one another along lines of motion which lead in the most direct manner to their destination, or they eddy about in sinuous paths the most indirect possible.” 

Reynolds figure out the transition point of a stable fluid turns into an unstable flow, is depends on the ratio between two forces, the inertial forces( defined by mass, velocity and distance) and viscous forces (defined by the stickiness of the fluid) 

Once the fluid passed the Reynolds Number( ie . it reaches the **critical mass**), the fluid will transit from stable flow to an turbulance.

Reynolds number is universal and appearing i blood pumping throuhg a heart and burning gas flowing through jet turbine.


> The notion of a Reynolds number and critical velocity can also be applied to non-traditional domains: for instance, the flow of information in a computer network, where velocity is represented by bandwidth and viscosity is represented by processing speed of the individual nodes, or the flow of money in an economy, where velocity is represented by how fast funds are moving and viscosity is represented by transaction costs. 

> Wherever things (including ideas) are either moving through a surrounding medium or flowing past a boundary of any kind, the notion of a Reynolds number can help characterize the relation between inertial forces and viscosity, giving a sense for what may happen next.
