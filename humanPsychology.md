#### Reward and punishment superesponse tendency

** What to Predict:** Behaviour and **cognition** of human what human want their cognition

** When to use it** Take advice from professional adviser

**How to Use it:**

**find out the incentives in the system** Incentives are what people want, the stronger ones are:

from [cas$hvertising][2]

Human beings are biologically programmed with the following eight desires:(LF8)

* Sexual companionship.
* To be superior, winning, keeping up with the Joneses
* Survival, enjoyment of life, life extension.
* Enjoyment of food and beverages.
* Freedom from fear, pain, and danger.
* Comfortable living conditions.
* Care and protection of loved ones.
* Social approval.

According to Haldeman-Julius, the two strongest appeals were sex and self-improvement. Surprised?

even know that someone else satisfy the LF8 will bring you gratification

to use LF8,

By using language that’s both specific and visual, I was able to install a mental movie inside your head.

**Examples**:

When it came to making big money selling books, mail order guru Haldeman-Julius wrote the book. During the 1920s and ’30s he sold more than 200 million of them, in nearly 2,000 different titles. They were simple little books, and they all cost just 5 cents each. To advertise his books, he placed ads consisting of only the books’ titles. If a book didn’t sell well, he’d change the ad copy, but not the way you’d expect. He actually changed the titles of the books! Then he’d sit back and study the response. How clever.

![Look what happened when the titles were changed based on the LF8.][3]

psychology wise of what human want, a good model is [SCARF][4]

Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, Fairness

* Tension → Desire → Action to Satisfy the Desire

> the first use of any product is inside the consumers’ minds. - CA$HVERTISING

* Use the incentive as a goal and try to predict how can someone maximum the incentive under the system

* Grandma rule, do the nesssary and unpleasnt task before rewarding and pleasant task

* Antidotes:

* Espeically fear professional advice when it is especially good for the advisor
* learn and use the basic elements of your advisor's trade as you deal with the advisor
* double check, disbelieve, or replace much of what you're told , to the degree that seems approciate after objective thoughts
* Crosscheck with numbers and predictions
* Tough internal audit systems
* Misbehaviour-preventing routings and such machines as cash registers

**Real world antidote example:** + cash register + sound acccounting system

Too Good to Be True: The Rise and Fall of Bernie Madoff

By Erin Arvedlund

What common denominator was there between all the people who suspected Medoff had problems but looked the other way? Shared greed is the natural first answer. Police investigating a mine always ask, "Who benefits from the crime?" Makin, Noel, Piedrahita, Masoke, Schulman, and others all shared a common intere,st. They all stood to lose a lot if they looked too closely and found something about Medoff that was mis convienent.

[Example: Federal Express, from Charlie Munger](https://old.ycombinator.com/munger.html)

>From all business, my favorite case on incentives is Federal Express. The heart and soul of their system—which creates the integrity of the product—is having all their airplanes come to one place in the middle of the night and shift all the packages from plane to plane. If there are delays, the whole operation can't deliver a product full of integrity to Federal Express customers.

>And it was always screwed up. They could never get it done on time. They tried everything—moral suasion, threats, you name it. And nothing worked.

The solution ?

>Finally, somebody got the idea to pay all these people not so much an hour, but so much a shift—and when it's all done, they can all go home. Well, their problems cleared up overnight.

So getting the incentives right is a very, very important lesson. It was not obvious to Federal Express what the solution was. But maybe now, it will hereafter more often be obvious to you.


[Example: Nucor steel incentive system](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/02/ken-iverson-incentive-systems/)

>Under Iverson, compensation at Nucor had two components: A small but meaningful base pay and a very simple weekly bonus based on production. Outside of benefits and a little profit sharing, that was it. Simple, straightforward, and powerful. No subjective criteria.

Why it works ?

* It align the goals, making more steel

* Offers immediate feedback, the weekly paid comes in

* Clarity, the employee can calculate his/her bonus in head

* Certainty, no subject thing

* * *

#### 4 Doubt-avoidance tendency

> “The real problem is not whether machines think but whether men do.” —Burrhus Frederic Skinner



**What to Predict:**

* Human reaction towards uncertainty and doubt; quickly remove doubt by reaching some deciscion.

* Huge discount towards uncertainty/probability
* Men will prefer $1 for sure rather than for 10% chance of winning $12.

Especially strong when:

* Under stress( 17. stress influence tendency)
* Misleaded ( 5. inconsistency avoidence tendency: 16. contrast-mis-react tendency)

**When to use it**

to yourself, when you face uncertainty and doubt

*example*

leap of faith in religious

$100 now is better than $115 ~ $130 on your next pay day( [pay day loan](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/1567/what-payday-loan.html)

* Offer a specific number, like $1,518.2 rather than $1,500



#### 5 inconsistency-avoidance tendency

it is also called confirmation bias.

> Another thing I think should be avoided is extremely intense ideology because it cabbages up one’s mind. You see it a lot with T.V. preachers (many have minds made of cabbage) but it can also happen with political ideology. When you’re young it’s easy to drift into loyalties and when you announce that you’re a loyal member and you start shouting the orthodox ideology out, what you’re doing is pounding it in, pounding it in, and you’re gradually ruining your mind. So you want to be very, very careful of this ideology. It’s a big danger. In my mind, I have a little example I use whenever I think about ideology. The example is these Scandinavia canoeists who succeeded in taming all the rapids of Scandinavia and they thought they would tackle the whirlpools of the Aron (sp) Rapids here in the United States. The death rate was 100%. A big whirlpool is not something you want to go into, and I think the same is true about a really deep ideology. - Charlie Munger



**What to Predict:**

Huamn tendency toward change: reluctant to change

**When to use it**
* To prevent extreme ideology from forming
* To prevent bad habit forming
* Before making **Important** decisions, look for disconfirming bias purposely


**How to Use it:**

* To defend yourself from it:

> I have what I call an iron prescription that helps me keep sane when I naturally drift toward preferring one ideology over another and that is: I say that I’m not entitled to have an opinion on this subject unless I can state the arguments against my position better than the people who support it. I think only when I’ve reached that state am I qualified to speak. - Charlie Munger



To offense:

**start small, and ask things in writing for opinions in your favor, and truth**

Example, Chinese POW in Korea

** ask for pulic committment

benz promotion for article contest

Example:

> Charles Darwin used to say that whenever he ran into something that contradicted a conclusion he cherished, he was obliged to write the new finding down within 30 minutes. Otherwise his mind would work to reject the discordant information, much as the body rejects transplants - Warrent Buffet

* Hear long and skillul presentations of evidence and argument from the side you are not naturally favor
* Put more weight on disconfirming evidence
* Make people do small, unimportant thing towards the goal you really want **It works on reverse also**, if you make a person hurting others, increasing their dislike and hatred for others

Examples [sell them $7 report before selling $40 product][5]

Example: Inoculation:

Theory is used to reinforce a consumer’s existing attitudes toward a product or service by presenting a “weak” argument that tricks the consumer into defending his position and therefore strengthening his attitude. The three steps are:

1. Warn of an impending attack.
2. Make a weak attack.
3. Encourage a strong defense.

>Inoculation is a favorite among politicians. Their stock line goes this way: “My opponent will tell you there’s no way to bring down skyrocketing oil prices...he’ll tell you that the only way to balance the national budget is to raise your taxes...he’ll tell you that it’s good enough to provide health insurance for most citizens, not all of them. But I tell you this is definitely not the case, and here is why....” Do you see what’s happening? This candidate is inoculating his audience by (1) warning them of an impending attack, (2) presenting the weak arguments his opponent will say during the campaign, and (3) encouraging a strong defense by giving them a little ammunition to help prepare for battle.


Eample: Boxed In

>someone knocks on your door and says, “Hi! Would you please sign my petition to help reduce neighborhood crime and make our streets safer?” No-brainer, right? So you sign away. Now that you’ve committed to that very reasonable stance, society expects you to remain consistent with it. And so you will. That’s why when the petitioner next says, “Great! Thank you. And now would you please make a small tax-deductible $3 donation because we need to buy two-way radios for the neighborhood watch?” Yikes. You’ve been boxed in, my friend.

#### 6 curiosity tendency

**What to Predict:**

Human Tendency towards unknown and new things

Curiosity and experimentation are at the heart of play. People intrinsically enjoy learning and adapting. We instinctively seek out opportunities to play.

**When to use it**

the motive must be fueled by the work itself, not the distraction.

Because the play motive is created by the work itself, play is the most direct and most powerful driver of high performance.

**How to Use it:**

* Bias towards knowing more
* Use Curiosity to arouse interest

John Median in [Brain Rules](http://www.amazon.com/Brain-Rules-Principles-Surviving-Thriving/dp/0979777720) give an example on how he use it to grasp students attention in his lecture.

He divided his lecture in 10 min segments, and the structure is like this:

* general introduction to the core ideas
* other 9 mins all elaborate to explain the idea
* bridge intro ( a joke, funny stuff to introduce into other ideas)

#### 9 reciprocation tendency

**What to Predict:**

Humans to reciprocate both flavors and disflavors

**When to use it**

**How to Use it:** to influcence others:

**first offer a small favor, later ask for a bigger favor**

**ask an unreasonable dispropontial flavor first, then ask a retreat offer later**


** How to ask for something without triggering the reciprocation effect from others:

Chris Voss in his excellent book [Never split the difference](http://www.audible.com/pd/Business/Never-Split-the-Difference-Audiobook/B01CF5O89G) explained how to ask for thing without triggering the reciprocation effect:

use **calibrated questions**:

The other party demanded $100 and you only can come up with $50, ask:

"How can I come up with $100 in such a short time"


example: how water gate proposal gets approved

Antidode to reciprocated hostility:

**defered reaction**, "you can always tell the man off tomorrow, if it is such a good idea." - Tom Murphy

Intensified for Reciprocate Favor:

**speedy up reaction**

**How to Oppose Reciprocate-favor** Don't let them accept any favors from vendors

**How to influcene others to do what you want**

"to add a window in the room, first insist to open a hole in the ceiling"


Example:
>Here’s another familiar example. Walk through many major U.S. airports and you might be handed a rose by a member of the Hare Krishna religious group. Upon accepting this free gift, you’re then asked to make a donation. Because you already accepted the gift, you’re compelled to comply. You’d feel badly if you didn’t. Ahhh...there’s that childhood training again, and it’s now a programmed response. At least now you’re aware of it, and now you can use it to your advantage.

Example:

>Jay Siff, a wonderful client of many years, uses the reciprocation principle to the hilt. His company, Moving Targets of Perkasie, Pennsylvania (MovingTargets.com), sends gift certificates to people who just moved into the neighborhood on behalf of his primarily restaurant and auto-shop clients. Free pizza, free entrée, free oil change. Not only does the service introduce new movers to the retailers’ businesses, but it also sets the reciprocation ball in motion. When they’re done chomping on that pizza, or driving away with a fresh oil fill—assuming they were both treated right and satisfied—not only do they have good feelings about the business, but they’re also far more likely to return and spend money,

#### 10 influcence-from-mere-association tendency

**What to Predict:**

Human will associate things happens together and fuse them, which lead to the [Halo effect, the term which introduce by Nassim Tableb in his book [The Black Swan](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1472777963&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Black+Swan)

As Jon Elster points out in [Explaining Social Behavior](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1107416418)

> People are often assumed to have personality traits (introvert, timid, etc.) as well as virtues (honesty, courage, etc.) or vices (the seven deadly sins, etc.). In folk psychology, these features are assumed to be stable over time and across situations. Proverbs in all languages testify to this assumption. “Who tells one lie will tell a hundred.” “Who lies also steals.” “Who steals an egg will steal an ox.” “Who keeps faith in small matters, does so in large ones.” “Who is caught red-handed once will always be distrusted.” If folk psychology is right, predicting and explaining behavior should be easy.

> A single action will reveal the underlying trait or disposition and allow us to predict behavior on an indefinite number of other occasions when the disposition could manifest itself. The procedure is not tautological, as it would be if we took cheating on an exam as evidence of dishonesty and then used the trait of dishonesty to explain the cheating. Instead, it amounts to using cheating on an exam as evidence for a trait (dishonesty) that will also cause the person to be unfaithful to a spouse. If one accepts the more extreme folk theory that all virtues go together, the cheating might also be used to predict cowardice in battle or excessive drinking.


* people will associated past success, liking/disliking with some random factor

* Shot the messager effect

* Could be a counter for recripocity. If the recripocity reminds a bad event.
* Often reinforce by doubt avoidence and consistency tendency ( combined known as confirmation error)

**When to use it**

associate the thing you want to sell with something good

**How to Use it:**

Antidote for new explorations base on past success:

* To carefully exampine each past success, looking for accidental, noncausative factors soociated with such sucess that will tend to mislead as one apprasies ods implicit in a proposed new undertaking
* To look for dangerous aspect of the new undertaking that were not present when past sucess occurred

Antidote for shot the messenger for yourself:

**develop a habit of welcoming bad news;**

"Always tell us the bad news promptly. It is only the good news that can wait"

**open different channels, be so wise and informed that people fear not telling you bad news because you are so likely to get it elsewhere**

Offensive:

associciate desirable, such as physical attractiveness, intelligence, economic success, and sexual prowess.

if consumers are presented with the “correct” images, people who possess these characteristics will buy them in order to publicize their ego

Example:

an attempt to appear as if they do. Interesting, isn’t it? So think about your product. Does owning or using it suggest qualities that people would want to flaunt? You own a karate school? Then spotlight the names of the big mixed martial arts stars who work out there. Then print and sell T-shirts that say “I train with [insert big-name star here].” Instant ego appeal.

You’re the most expensive dog groomer in town? Show photos of the rich celebrities who bring in their pooches. Feature Mr. or Ms. Celeb stepping out of a limo with a drooling pooch. “Oh, yes...there are plenty of other groomers in town, but pshaw! I only trust the Karringtons with my Fluffy.” So snotty, but—BOOM!—instant ego appeal.

Example:[CBS network, from Charlie Munger](https://old.ycombinator.com/munger.html)

>Television was dominated by one network—CBS in its early days. And Paley was a god. But he didn't like to hear what he didn't like to hear. And people soon learned that. So they told Paley only what he liked to hear. Therefore, he was soon living in a little cocoon of unreality and everything else was corrupt—although it was a great business.

>So the idiocy that crept into the system was carried along by this huge tide. It was a Mad Hatter's tea party the last ten years under Bill Paley.

>And that is not the only example by any means. You can get severe misfunction in the high ranks of business. And of course, if you're investing, it can make a lot of difference. If you take all the acquisitions that CBS made under Paley, after the acquisition of the network itself, with all his advisors—his investment bankers, management consultants and so forth who were getting paid very handsomely—it was absolutely terrible.

>For example, he gave something like 20% of CBS to the Dumont Company for a television set manufacturer which was destined to go broke. I think it lasted all of two or three years or something like that. So very soon after he'd issued all of that stock, Dumont was history. You get a lot of dysfunction in a big fat, powerful place where no one will bring unwelcome reality to the boss.

#### 12 excessive self-regard tendency

or, the it known as ego.

> by Pratkanis and Aronson (Age of Propaganda, 1991), when they said, “By purchasing the ‘right stuff,’ we [the consumer] enhance our own egos

> When you see the Marlboro man, it’s your ego—not your craving for paper tubes stuffed with tobacco—that motivates you to switch brands.

> Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac -George Carlin

* fixable but unfixed bad performance is bad character and tends to create more of itself, causing more damage to the execuse giver with each tolerated in stance.

* in a demaning placs, like athletic teams and general electric, you are almost sure to be discarded in due course if you keep giving execuses instead of behaving as you should. Antidode for this bias:

* build a fair, metritocatic demanding culture plus personnel handling methods that build up morale

* serverance of the worse offenders

To influcence others:

In Chris Voss's Excellent book , [Never Split the Difference: Negotiating as if Your Life Depended on It](http://www.audible.com/pd/Business/Never-Split-the-Difference-Audiobook/B01CF5O89G/ref=a_search_c4_1_1_srTtl?qid=1481851398&sr=1-1)

He mentions as a FBI hostage neogotiator, one of the techniques to gather trust of the other party is called Mirroring.

Repeat 3-4 **words** from the other party, and add a few second of silence and will work magics.

permission based marketing:

[Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/01/permission-mark.html) used the term permission based marketing to frame how marketer are using this technique to sale.
> Permission marketing is the privilege (not the right) of delivering anticipated, personal, and relevant messages to people who actually want to get them.

> It recognizes the new power of the best consumers to ignore marketing. It realizes that treating people with respect is the best way to earn their attention.

> Pay attention is a key phrase here, because permission marketers understand that when someone chooses to pay attention they are actually paying you with something precious…

> Real permission works like this: if you stop showing up, people complain, they ask where you went…

> Permission is like dating. You do not start by asking for the sale at first impression. You earn the right, over time, bit by bit…

> In order to get permission, you make a promise. You say, “I will do x, y and z, I hope you will give me permission by listening.” And then, this is the hard part, that's all you do. You do not assume you can do more. You do not sell the list or rent the list or demand more attention…

Example: Benfranklin Techinque:

Benfranklin mentioned how he used this techique to turn a rival into a long term friendship:

He knows his rival build a small library and posses a valuable out of print book, he send him a note asking if he can do Benfranklin a favor, to lend his book for a few days. The rival agrees, then Benfranklin return the book in a week and with a note of expressing appreciation.

After than the rival just turn 180% degree became friend of Ben franklin, just like magic.

This trojan horse technique also one of the most effective sales scheme.

> Offering the first chapter of a book for free to people who join an email list — Having read the chapter and received more emails which connect them to the author, people are more likely to buy the full book than they would have been if they had only seen an advert.
Creating free high-quality blog content for an audience to enjoy — Once people are interested in the blogger's voice and expertise, the marketing can begin. Many people will at some point want to support the person whose work they have been consuming for free. This support might include buying courses, books, or consulting services or donating to a Patreon page. We developed the learning community as not only a bunch of extras for people but also a means to support the free content we provide.
Writing a book detailing an expert's specialized knowledge — While sales of the book are often not high, having it published benefits the expert's business. For example, Ryan Holiday has stated that his books have led to more income from speaking and consulting than from actual book sales.
Making the most income from revenue streams which do not appear to be the main objective of a business — For example, high-fashion brands often make more money from perfume than from clothing, cinemas rely on sales of popcorn and drinks, and some restaurants profit predominantly from sales of alcohol.
Creating viral branded content which people share and engage with due to its being interesting and often amusing — For example, just try to watch the Android “Friends Furever” video without forwarding it to at least one person. The adorable video wraps up a marketing message, making people more likely to pay attention to it.  -- [The Trojan Horse: How Marketers, Retailers, and Artists Conceal Their True Intents](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/07/trojan-horse/)

deprival superraeaction tendency and inconsistency-avoideance oftehn join togehter

Examples:

* Man gradually used up all his good assets in a attempt to rescure a big venture going bad
* Auctions


**live examples**

riches will compare with what is near instead of what really matters, a man with 10 million in his brokerage account will often be extremly irritated by the loss of $100 out of the $300 in his wallet

Protect his/her ideological or religious views by triggering hatred directed toward vocal nonbelivers.

When the vocal critic is a former believer, hostility is often boosted both by:

* a concept of betrayal that triggers additianl deprival superraeaction
* featrs that conflicting views will have extra persuasive power when they come from a former colleague

** Example New Coke**

>But it was an eighty-five-year-old woman who convinced me we had to do something more than stay the course. She had called the company in tears from a retirement home in Covina, California. I happened to be visiting the call center and took the call. “You’ve taken away my Coke,” she sobbed. “When was the last time you had a Coke?” I asked. “Oh, I don’t know. About twenty, twenty-five years ago.” “Then why are you so upset?” I asked. “Young man, you are playing around with my youth and you should stop it right now. Don’t you have any idea what Coke means to me?” It became crystal clear that we were not dealing with a taste issue or any real marketing issue. All the experts and all their data had been misleading. This was a deep psychological issue. A brand is not defined by what you or I think it is. A brand is defined by what is embedded in the mind of each consumer. Because Coca-Cola is consumed by so many individuals in so many cultures, it is defined differently by every person.

* Chris Voss in his excellent book [Never split the difference](http://www.audible.com/pd/Business/Never-Split-the-Difference-Audiobook/B01CF5O89G) mentions a system of negotiations using this effect:

* set a target price:

* first offer 75% of your target price

* then offer 85%,95%,100% of your target price

* drop an non-monetary item with your final 100% target

___ Example: Broken Windows theory

> The broken windows theory is a criminological theory of the norm-setting and signaling effect of urban disorder and vandalism on additional crime and anti-social behavior. The theory states that maintaining and monitoring urban environments to prevent small crimes such as vandalism, public drinking, and toll-jumping helps to create an atmosphere of order and lawfulness, thereby preventing more serious crimes from happening.


**Antidote to yourself:**

zero base thinking

In Too Good to Be True: The Rise and Fall of Bernie Madoff

By Erin Arvedlund

> It gives out an insight why so many successful—and, therefore, supposedly intelligent—people were so susceptible to Medoff s duplicity. "There were many seasoned market professionals, whom one would otherwise describe as intelligent and rational, who were taken in," said Christopher Miller of Allenbridge Hedgelnfo.

"Some of them may have thought they understood the split-strike strategy, but no one else was doing anything similar they could compare with So instead of concentrating on the red flags, we looked for masons why such people could be duped."

> Double avoidance tendency

He came up with a few groups. The first was compfised of Investors who did due diligence, knew that there were concerns surrounding Medoff, and so allocated only a relatively small percentage with the firm. For them, it was worth the risk if they could get the returns. "Those people have a high level of tolerance for things they don't understand, or for being lied to," Miller said.

Another group were investors who did due diligence, knew that there mere questions, but since Medoff had been running so long, was known to give money back instantly, and was so well regarded, they figured such allegations must he baseless.

> social prove,

“These people have found the red flags, but then they start looking for reasons to ignore them. They want a money manager who is a profit-seeking type."

Then there were investors who knew someone else had done due diligence and invested but who didn't know the concerns. "These people were cheapskates. It's all right to use a third party to do due diligence, but they invested even though they had not read the reports." This group includes investors through feeder funds, who did no due diligence because they were sold investments by regulated firms audited by big-name auditors who hadn't asked enough questions.

> Incentive tendency

Fairfield Greenwich, for one, shopped for three separate auditors over a period of three years. Auditors accepted the documentation they were given and the opinions from the tiny auditor that Medoff used "This is not just a hedge fund issue, this is a global auditing issue. There is no suggestion that big-name auditors did anything illegal," Miller said, but perhaps their terms of reference need to be looked at.

What common denominator was there between all the people who suspected Medoff had problems but looked the other way? Shared greed is the natural first answer. Police investigating a mine always ask, "Who benefits from the crime?" Makin, Noel, Piedrahita, Masoke, Schulman, and others all shared a common intere,st. They all stood to lose a lot if they looked too closely and found something about Medoff that was mis convienent.

> Incentive tendency

Examples

Fact: No matter how often you wash your sheets, your bed is an insect breeding ground, teeming with thousands of hideous, crab-like dust mites aggressively laying eggs in your pillow and mattress, causing you and your family to suffer year-long allergy attacks. While you sleep, they actually wake up and start to crawl, eat your skin flakes, and drink the moisture on your flesh. It gets worse. Did you know that 10 percent of the weight of a two-year-old pillow is actually dead mites and their feces? This means that every night you and your family are sleeping in the equivalent of an insect’s toilet, actually covered in a mélange of both their living and dead bodies, and oceans of their bitter excrement.

#### 27 Repetion and redunancy- The familiarity factor

Whatever the actual number is, repetition is an important factor in getting your point across in advertising. Repeating your message not only helps break down walls of disinterest, but with each repetition your ad also gets exposed to those who may not have noticed it the last time. What’s more, with each repetition of your message, your audience naturally grows more familiar with your product and company. And unless they have some reason to think otherwise, a feeling of acceptance begins to grow.

It touches on what’s called multiple sources and multiple arguments. Simply put, the more different sources that expose a subject to the same message, the more convinced the subject will become.
