# Introduction

> "compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it ... he who doesn't ... pays it.” Albert Einstein

Compound Interest is mathematics representation of of positive feedback.

We all well aware of the power of compounding, in money terms. If we have an asset we want it to compound at a high interest rate

But is that money the only thing compounds ?

**You can compound yourself too.** people rise in life compound themselves every day.

> "I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not even the most diligent, but they are learning machines. They go to bed every night a little wiser than they were when they got up and boy does that help, particularly when you have a long run ahead of you." - Charlie Munger USC Law Commencement Speech, May 2007


Just as [James Altucher](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/) stated in his [one percent rule][2]

> Improve a little each day. It compounds. When 1% compounds every day, it doubles every 72 days, not every 100 days. Compounding tiny excellence is what creates big excellence.


## How to use this mental Model

Identify your compounding base.

* What do you want to compound ?

* Is that compoundable ?



Compounding takes time and effort, make sure your the base is solid. You dont want to compound the castle build on sand.

* When does it compound ? by time or in turn ?


The secret of why owning a business could potentially make you rich much faster.

Business compounds when a transaction happens, and your bank account number only compounds with time.

[High frequency trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading) is a very good example of that.

HFTs earn only a tiny profits per trade, but with a lot of trades per day, the profit quickly compounds.




## Conditions:

A base that can be compound.

## Predictions:

You can use law of 72 to calculate how fast it can grown.

The signature of Compound Interest occurring is the famous hockey stick diagram:

## Peer Lattice: Power Law:


> In statistics, a power law is a functional relationship between two quantities, where a relative change in one quantity results in a proportional relative change in the other quantity, independent of the initial size of those quantities: one quantity varies as a power of another. For instance, considering the area of a square in terms of the length of its side, if the length is doubled, the area is multiplied by a factor of four

Examples of power law:([wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law))

> More than a hundred power-law distributions have been identified in physics (e.g. sandpile avalanches), biology (e.g. species extinction and body mass), and the social sciences (e.g. city sizes and income).[14] Among them are:

The Angstrom exponent in aerosol optics
The frequency-dependency of acoustic attenuation in complex media
The Stevens' power law of psychophysics
The Stefan–Boltzmann law
The input-voltage–output-current curves of field-effect transistors and vacuum tubes approximate a square-law relationship, a factor in "tube sound".
Square-cube law (ratio of surface area to volume)
Kleiber's law relating animal metabolism to size, and allometric laws in general




## Example

Why do Stock market out perform bonds ?

[In Warrent Buffett on the stock markets][3], Warren Buffet explains why stock market out performs bonds by attributing to compound interest.

> To report what Edgar Lawrence Smith discovered, I will quote a legendary thinker--John Maynard Keynes, who in 1925 reviewed the book, thereby putting it on the map. In his review, Keynes described "perhaps Mr. Smith's most important point ... and certainly his most novel point. Well-managed industrial companies do not, as a rule, distribute to the shareholders the whole of their earned profits. In good years, if not in all years, they retain a part of their profits and put them back in the business. Thus there is an element of compound interest (Keynes' italics) operating in favor of a sound industrial investment."
>
> It was that simple. It wasn't even news. People certainly knew that companies were not paying out 100% of their earnings. But investors hadn't thought through the implications of the point. Here, though, was this guy Smith saying, "Why do stocks typically outperform bonds? A major reason is that businesses retain earnings, with these going on to generate still more earnings--and dividends, too."

That finding ignited an unprecedented bull market. Galvanized by Smith's insight, investors piled into stocks, anticipating a double dip: their higher initial yield over bonds, and growth to boot. For the American public, this new understanding was like the discovery of fire.
