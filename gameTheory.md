# Introductions

Game theory is the science of analysing conflicts and cooperations and the optimal decisions.

One classic example is [prisoner's dilemma](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0324589972)

> The prisoners’ dilemma is a story about two criminals who have been captured by the police. Let’s call them Mr Black and Mr Pink. The police have enough evidence to convict Mr Black and Mr Pink of a relatively minor crime, illegal possession of a handgun, so that each would spend a year in jail. The police also suspect that the two criminals have committed a jewelery robbery together, but they lack hard evidence to convict them of this major crime. The police question Mr Black and Mr Pink in separate rooms, and they offer each of them the following deal:

>Right now we can lock you up for 1 year. If you confess to the jewelery robbery and implicate your partner, however, we’ll give you immunity and you can go free. Your partner will get 20 years in jail. But if you both confess to the crime, we won’t need your testimony and we can avoid the cost of a trial, so you will each get an intermediate sentence of 8 years.

> If Mr Black and Mr Pink, heartless criminals that they are, care only about their own sentences, what would you expect them to do? Would they confess or remain silent? Each prisoner has two strategies: confess or remain silent. The sentence each prisoner gets depends on the strategy chosen by his or her partner in crime.

> Consider first Mr Black’s decision. He reasons as follows:

> I don’t know what Mr Pink is going to do. If he remains silent, my best strategy is to confess, since then I’ll go free rather than spending a year in jail. If he confesses, my best strategy is still to confess, since then I’ll spend 8 years in jail rather than 20. So, regardless of what Mr Pink does, I am better off confessing.

Mr Black's thinking

. | I Confess| I Remain Silient
---|---|---
Mr Pink Confess| I got 8 Years in Prison |I got 20 years in Prison !
Mr Pink Silent| I got out free! | I got 1 year in prison!

From Mr Black's Perspective, Confess yields better expected outcome, regardless of Mr. Pink's action.

The situation is symmetric. From Mr. Pink's Perspective, confess also yields better outcome.

In of Game Theory, it is called **Nash Equilibrium**

Once Nash Equilibrium is reached, it will not be deviated from.


## How to use this mental Model:



### Conditions:

It applies when:

* There are at least two players, and players doesn't nessarary means human.

* Player is logical and will make decisions purely for his/her own benefit.

* When they are making decisions, there is no communication between these players.



### Predictions:


* Short Term/One Turn Scenario

The best strategy is to make as much as possible, regardless of the expense of other players.

In Tic-Tak-Toe, means always defect

* Mutiple Turn Scenario

The best strategy is to cooperate. but counter when the opponent defect.
