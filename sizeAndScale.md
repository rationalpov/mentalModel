# Introductions


A regular ants can lift up 20 to 100 times of its own weight, depends on the species of the ant. 

Hossein Rezazadeh of Iran, one of the greatest weightlifters of all times, can lift up to 2.5X of his own body weight.

Why is the difference? Why we can't lift up to 20 to 100 times of our own weight ? if we scale up ant to a human size, can it lift up a van?

Probably not, because of size and scales:

Imaging a cube filled with water, with 1cm in lengh, the cube will has a surface area of 6cm, and weight 1g

if we scale the cube to 10cm in lengh, the cube will has a surface area of 600cm, and weight 1000 g

we can see from this example, the lengh scales 10X, the surface area scales 100X, and weight, scales to 1000X
