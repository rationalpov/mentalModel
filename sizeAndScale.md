A regular ants can lift up 20 to 100 times of its own weight, depends on the species of the ant. 

Hossein Rezazadeh of Iran, one of the greatest weightlifters of all times, can lift up to 2.5X of his own body weight.

Why is the difference? Why we can't lift up to 20 to 100 times of our own weight ? if we scale up ant to a human size, can it lift up a van?

Probably not, because of size and scales:

Imaging a cube filled with water, with 1cm in lengh, the cube will has a surface area of 6cm, and weight 1g

if we scale the cube to 10cm in lengh, the cube will has a surface area of 600cm, and weight 1000 g

we can see from this example, the lengh scales 10X, the surface area scales 100X, and size, scales to 1000X

In our physical world, Strengh is a function of objects cross area. but the weight is a function of the size.

That means if we scale an ant by 10 times, its legs cross section area only increase by 100 times, but need to support 1000 times the current weight. 

This scaling effect has huge implication on the things around us:

Why Giants were sitting down, and why large animal has a different shape than small one

From [power, sex, suicide, mitochondria and the meaning of life]

> Different organs and tissues respond differently to an increase in body size. A good example is bone. Like muscle, the strength of bone depends on the cross-sectional area, but unlike muscle the bone is metabolically almost inert. Both factors influence scaling. Imagine a 6o-foot giant— ten times taller, ten times wider, and ten times thicker than an ordinary man. This is an example from Haldane again, who cites the giants Pope and Pagan from The Pilgrim’s Progress— one of the few references that dates his essay, as I doubt that many science writers today would turn to Bunyan for an everyday analogy. Because bone strength depends on cross-sectional area, the giants’ bones are 100 times the strength of ours, but the weight they must bear is 1000 times greater. Each square inch of giant bone must withstand ten times the weight of our own. Because the human thigh bone breaks under about ten times the human weight, Pope and Pagan would break their thighs every time they took a step. Haldane supposes this is why they were sitting down in his illustration.

> The scaling of bone strength to weight explains why large, heavy animals need to be a different shape to smaller, lighter ones. Such a relationship was first described by Galileo in his Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences, a delightful title that could hardly be matched these days. Galileo observed that the bones of larger animals grew more quickly in breadth than in length, compared with the slender bones of small animals. Sir Julian Huxley put Galileo’s ideas on a firm mathematical footing in the 1930s. For a bone to retain the same strength relative to weight, its cross-sectional area must change at the same rate as body weight. Let’s restrain ourselves to doubling the dimensions of our giant. His volume, and therefore weight, increases eightfold (23). To support this extra weight, his bones must grow eightfold in cross-sectional area. However, bones have length as well as cross-sectional area. If their cross-section is raised eightfold, and their length doubled, the skeleton is now sixteen (or 24) times heavier. In other words, the skeleton takes up a greater proportion of body mass. Theoretically, the scaling exponent is 4/ 3, or 1.33, although in reality it is less than this (about 1.08) because bone strength is not constant. Nonetheless, as Galileo realized in 1637, bone mass imposes an insurmountable limit on the size of any animal that must support its own weight— the point at which bone mass catches up with total mass. Whales can surpass the size limit of terrestrial animals because they are supported by the density of water.
