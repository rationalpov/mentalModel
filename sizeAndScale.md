# Introductions


A regular ants can lift up 20 to 100 times of its own weight, depends on the species of the ant. 

Hossein Rezazadeh of Iran, one of the greatest weightlifters of all times, can lift up to 2.5X of his own body weight.

Why is the difference? Why we can't lift up to 20 to 100 times of our own weight ? if we scale up ant to a human size, can it lift up a van?

Probably not, because of size and scales:

Imaging a cube filled with water, with 1cm in lengh, the cube will has a surface area of 6cm, and weight 1g

if we scale the cube to 10cm in lengh, the cube will has a surface area of 600cm, and weight 1000 g

we can see from this example, the lengh scales 10X, the surface area scales 100X, and size, scales to 1000X

In our physical world, Strengh is a function of objects cross area. but the weight is a function of the size.

That means if we scale an ant by 10 times, its legs cross section area only increase by 100 times, but need to support 1000 times the current weight. 

This scaling effect has huge implication on the things around us:

Why Elephant has huge ears?

it is because elephant is warm blooded,
