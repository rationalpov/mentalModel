Why is it important ?

Twos words: __Predictions__ and __Simplicity__

* It gives the ultimate power. Knowing and predicting the __future__.

* It creates a framework of __assimilating__ fragmented informations, which arguably a must have in this digital age.

* It also __cut off the bloat__ and expose whats essential, thus simplified the thinking.


One of the most briliant mind of the last century, Claude Shannon, gave a [speech](http://www1.ece.neu.edu/~naderi/Claude%20Shannon.html)  on creative thinking to a small group in bell labs.

it explains perfectly on what can mental model helps you to solve problems

> The first one that I might speak of is the idea of simplification. Suppose that you are given a problem to solve, I don’t care what kind of a problem - a machine to design, or a physical theory to develop, or a mathematical theorem to prove, or something of that kind - probably a very powerful approach to this is to attempt to eliminate everything from the problem except the essentials; that is, cut it down to size. Almost every problem that you come across is befuddled with all kinds of extraneous data of one sort or another; and if you can bring this problem down into the main issues, you can see more clearly what you’re trying to do and perhaps find a solution. Now, in so doing, you may have stripped away the problem that you’re after. You may have simplified it to a point that it doesn’t even resemble the problem that you started with; but very often if you can solve this simple problem, you can add refinements to the solution of this until you get back to the solution of the one you started with.


> A very similar device is seeking similar known problems. I think I could illustrate this schematically in this way. You have a problem P here and there is a solution S which you do not know yet perhaps over here. If you have experience in the field represented, that you are working in, you may perhaps know of a somewhat similar problem, call it P', which has already been solved and which has a solution, S', all you need to do - all you may have to do is find the analogy from P' here to P and the same analogy from S' to S in order to get back to the solution of the given problem. This is the reason why experience in a field is so important that if you are experienced in a field, you will know thousands of problems that have been solved. Your mental matrix will be filled with P's and S's unconnected here and you can find one which is tolerably close to the P that you are trying to solve and go over to the corresponding S' in order to go back to the S you’re after. It seems to be much easier to make two small jumps than the one big jump in any kind of mental thinking.

> Another approach for a given problem is to try to restate it in just as many different forms as you can. Change the words. Change the viewpoint. Look at it from every possible angle. After you’ve done that, you can try to look at it from several angles at the same time and perhaps you can get an insight into the real basic issues of the problem, so that you can correlate the important factors and come out with the solution. It’s difficult really to do this, but it is important that you do. If you don’t, it is very easy to get into ruts of mental thinking. You start with a problem here and you go around a circle here and if you could only get over to this point, perhaps you would see your way clear; but you can’t break loose from certain mental blocks which are holding you in certain ways of looking at a problem. That is the reason why very frequently someone who is quite green to a problem will sometimes come in and look at it and find the solution like that, while you have been laboring for months over it. You’ve got set into some ruts here of mental thinking and someone else comes in and sees it from a fresh viewpoint.

> Another mental gimmick for aid in research work, I think, is the idea of generalization. This is very powerful in mathematical research. The typical mathematical theory developed in the following way to prove a very isolated, special result, particular theorem - someone always will come along and start generalization it. He will leave it where it was in two dimensions before he will do it in N dimensions; or if it was in some kind of algebra, he will work in a general algebraic field; if it was in the field of real numbers, he will change it to a general algebraic field or something of that sort. This is actually quite easy to do if you only remember to do it. If the minute you’ve found an answer to something, the next thing to do is to ask yourself if you can generalize this anymore - can I make the same, make a broader statement which includes more - there, I think, in terms of engineering, the same thing should be kept in mind. As you see, if somebody comes along with a clever way of doing something, one should ask oneself °∞Can I apply the same principle in more general ways? Can I use this same clever idea represented here to solve a larger class of problems? Is there any place else that I can use this particular thing?°


**Example**:

What is the most famous and impactful mental model in human history?

One of them could well be [Newton's three laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion).

![newton](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg)

[Newton This a copy of a painting by Sir Godfrey Kneller(1689). This copy was painted by Barrington Bramley](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=37337)

through the lens of Newton laws of motion, it gives whats really matters to predict objects in motion, only mass and it's speed.

its color, smell, taste and thousands other attribute doesn't matter.



# What are Lattice Work of mental models ?


The term Lattice work of Mental Models is widely known from Charlie Munger, the vice chairman of Berkshire-Hathaway, in [a speech to USC graduate](https://old.ycombinator.com/munger.html) on 1994.


## How to create and use a lattice work of mental models ?

How did Charlie Munger built his lattice work of mental models ?

In the book Damn Right!: Behind the Scenes with Berkshire Hathaway Billionaire Charlie Munger, Munger talks about the fundamentals of organizing etho:

>* you must both rank and use disciplines in order of fundamentalness
>* you must, like it or not, master to tested fluency and routinely use the truly essential parts of all four constituents of the fundamental four-discipline combination, whith particulartly intense attension given to disciplines more fundamental than your own, focus one first and test it to fluency:
>* you may never practice either crossdisciplinary absorption without attribution or departure from a "principle of economy" that forbids explanining in any other way anything readily explainable from more dundamental material in your own or any other discipline.
>* But when the step four approach doesn't produce much new and useful insight, you should hypothesize, and test to establishement, new principle ordinarily by using methods similar to those that created successful old principles, But you may not use any new principle, inconsistent with an old one, unless you can now prove that the old principle is not true.

And Three other principles on how to use the mental models:

>* the first rule is that you can't really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang 'em back. If the facts don't hang together on a latticework of theory, you don't have them in a usable form.
>* you must able to convolute these models in your head!
>* you must use attribution to array your experience, both vicarious and direct, on the allticework of of models .

In Layman's term, If you want to build and use a lattice work of mental models, you need to do the following:

* Collect and create A checklist of mental models, and how could you use it
* Memorize the list( by using Anki or other flash card tools)
* Pratice using the mental lattice by using examples and simuations(with predefinited answer), and connect your daily experience (both direct or indirect) to your lattice.

It is definitely not easy , but doable.

The good thing is, Charlie Munger mentions there are only roughly 100 mental models in his lattice work of mental models, and he mentioned some of them already.

There are already couple of very good blogs talks about various mental models, and couple of good books also. But I find it difficult to use these mental models, for two reasons:

* Not enough examples. Human learn best by example.
* Don't have a trigger. Standalone mental model is useless. You need a trigger( as input) so you can apply the mental models.
* No Attribution, Mental Model should by connected to form a lattice.

The best way to learn something is to teach it, I figured I could learn mental model faster by try to teaching it, and hope you can find some bits useful along the way.


## How to maintain and use these mental models ?

Straight from Munger:

> 1) His formal education is wide enough to cover practically everything useful in piloting.

>2) His knowledge of practically everything needed by pilots is not taught just well enough to enable him to pass one test or two; instead, all of his knowledge is raised to practice-based fluency, even in handling two or three intertwined hazards at once.

>3) Like any good algebraist, he is made to think sometimes in a forward fashion and sometimes in reverse; and so he learns when to concentrate mostly on what he wants to happen and also when to concentrate mostly on avoiding what he does not want to happen.

>4) His training time is allocated among subjects so as to minimize damage from his later malfunctions; and so what is most important in his performance gets the most training coverage and is raised to the highest fluency levels.

>5) “Checklist” routines are always mandatory for him

>6) Even after original training he is forced into a special knowledge-maintenance routine: regular use of the aircraft simulator to prevent atrophy through long disuse of skills needed to cope with rare and important problems.

>The need for this clearly correct six-element system, with its large demands in a narrow-scale field where stakes are high, is rooted in the deep structure of the human mind. Therefore, we must expect that the education we need for broad scale problem-solving will keep all these elements but with awesomely expanded coverage for each element. How could it be otherwise?


Also from Richard Freeman:

* Choose a Concept
* Teach it to a Toddler
* Identify Gaps and Go Back to The Source Material
* Review and Simplify

This blog is try to utilize Richard Freeman and Mungers's advice to create a mental lattice. 

## what mental model should I learn first ?

> People underrate the importance of a few simple big ideas – the chief lesson is that a few big ideas really work. --charlie munger

what is a big idea ? big idea means the most fundamental mental model, the one you will see the most often. for example. simple algebra.
