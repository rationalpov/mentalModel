Margin of Safety is another mental model to increase system reliability, same as backup system.


## How to use this mental Model:

backup system is useful when adding a backup system is either too costly or not quite possible.

for example, when you design a bridge, it is no point of adding a smaller bridge right beside it.

margin of safety is handy in this scenario


> Factor of safety: is a term describing the load carrying capacity of a system beyond the expected or actual loads. Essentially, the factor of safety is how much stronger the system is than it usually needs to be for an intended load. Safety factors are often calculated using detailed analysis because comprehensive testing is impractical on many projects, such as bridges and buildings, but the structure's ability to carry load must be determined to a reasonable accuracy.
